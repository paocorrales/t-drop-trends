The analysis highlights several coherent regions of statistically significant change in the frequency of fronts. The front frequency in the North Atlantic storm track has decreased by about 10--20\%, whereas changes observed over the Southern Ocean are relatively small. In the subtropical Pacific the front frequency has increased significantly, which is consistent with an expansion of the dry subtropics. The sensitivity of these trends to the detection method is tested and the results are found to be robust.

The frontal activity is represented by an index that takes into account the vorticity, the gradient of temperature and the specific humidity at the 850~hPa level. ERA-Interim reanalysis and GPCP datasets are used to assess the performance of the models in the present climate. Overall, it is found that the models can reproduce adequately the main features of frontal activity and front frequency over the SH. The total precipitation is overestimated in most of the models, especially the maximum values over the mid latitudes. This overestimation could be related to the high values of precipitation frequency that are identified in some of the models evaluated. The relationship between fronts and precipitation has also been evaluated in terms of both frequency of frontal precipitation and percentage of precipitation due to fronts. In general terms, the models overestimate the proportion between frontal and total precipitation. In contrast with frequency of total precipitation, the frequency of frontal precipitation is well reproduced by the models, with the higher values located at the mid latitudes. The results suggest that models represent very well the dynamic forcing (fronts) and the frequency of frontal precipitation, though the amount of precipitation due to fronts is overestimated.},

  abstract = {Human-caused climate changes are increasing the risk of dangerous wildfires in many regions of the world. There are multiple, compounding aspects of climate change that are increasing fire risk, including large-scale climate changes driving hotter and drier conditions that are generally well observed and predicted. However, changes in synoptic-scale processes that can exacerbate dangerous fire weather and promote extreme pyroconvective events are often not well known in historical observations and are poorly represented in climate models, making it difficult to fully quantify and anticipate changing fire risk. In this study, we statistically test the association between synoptic-scale cold front passage and large fires in southeast Australia during Australia's 2019--2020 `Black Summer' fire disaster, and analyse daily gridded temperature data to detect long-term changes in the intensity and frequency of strong cold fronts over southeast Australia. We demonstrate that the passage of cold fronts over southeast Australia significantly increased the likelihood of large fire days during the entire Black Summer fire season. Additionally, the intensity and frequency of strong cold front events were anomalously high during the Black Summer, and this is part of a long-term significant increase in the intensity and frequency of strong cold fronts since the 1950s. These changes in fire-promoting cold front activity are expected to imminently emerge above the range of historical experience across large areas of southeast Australia if current trends continue. Our results provide new insights into a previously poorly constrained contributor to fire risk in southeast Australia, highlighting the potential of synoptic-scale weather changes to compound previously documented broad-scale climate changes in intensifying future forest fire risk.},

In some parts of the major midlatitude storm track regions, over 90\% of precipitation extremes are associated with fronts, with slightly more events associated with warm fronts than cold fronts. On average, 51\% of global precipitation extremes are associated with fronts, with 75\% in the midlatitudes and 31\% in the tropics. A large proportion of extreme precipitation events occur in the presence of both a cyclone and a front, but remote fronts are responsible for many of the ``front-only'' events. The fronts producing extreme precipitation events are found to have up to 35\% stronger frontal gradients than other fronts, potentially providing some improved forecasting capabilities for extreme precipitation events.},

The models show some biases in the location of the front frequency maxima. Future changes are estimated using the high emissions scenario simulations (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). Projections show an overall decrease in front frequency in the Northern Hemisphere, with a poleward shift of the maxima of front frequency and a strong decrease at high latitudes where the temperature gradient is decreased. The Southern Hemisphere shows a poleward shift of the frequency maximum, consistent with previous storm track studies.},

An objective front identification method has been applied to the data from ERA-Interim and 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, version 5 (CMIP5) models and the fronts linked with daily precipitation estimates to investigate how winter front-related precipitation is represented in the models. While the front frequency is well represented, the frequency of frontal precipitation is too high and the intensity is too low, thus adding little bias to the rainfall total.

  abstract = {CMIP5 multimodel ensemble projection of midlatitude storm track changes has been examined. Storm track activity is quantified by temporal variance of meridional wind and sea level pressure (psl), as well as cyclone track statistics. For the Southern Hemisphere (SH), CMIP5 models project clear poleward migration, upward expansion, and intensification of the storm track. For the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the models also project some poleward shift and upward expansion of the storm track in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, but mainly weakening of the storm track toward its equatorward flank in the troposphere. Consistent with these, CMIP5 models project significant increase in the frequency of extreme cyclones during the SH cool season, but significant decrease in such events in the NH. Comparisons with CMIP3 projections indicate high degrees of consistency for SH projections, but significant differences are found in the NH. Overall, CMIP5 models project larger decrease in storm track activity in the NH troposphere, especially over North America in winter, where psl variance as well as cyclone frequency and amplitude are all projected to decrease significantly. In terms of climatology, similar to CMIP3, most CMIP5 models simulate storm tracks that are too weak and display equatorward biases in their latitude. These biases have also been related to future projections. In the NH, the strength of a model's climatological storm track is negatively correlated with its projected amplitude change under global warming, while in the SH, models with large equatorward biases in storm track latitude tend to project larger poleward shifts.},

Most previous mechanisms for the poleward shift of the storm tracks~focused on the role of atmospheric temperature changes. However, the relative roles of other climate system components in the projected storm tracks' shift have not been examined to date. Here it is shown that thermodynamic ocean coupling is responsible for the future poleward shift of the storm tracks as it overcomes the effect of dynamic ocean coupling to shift the storm tracks equatorward. These results stress the importance of using full-physics ocean models to investigate the future shift of the storm tracks, and of better monitoring ocean coupling processes to improve our preparedness for future climate changes.},

  abstract = {By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850--near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:   \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?  \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?   \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?  This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

However, in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics, the circulation response to CO2 is largely absent in the zonal mean and is instead characterized by complex regional anomalies. This study decomposes the atmospheric circulation response to CO2 forcing in CMIP5 models into two components: a direct component due to CO2 radiative forcing and an indirect component associated with sea surface temperature (SST)-mediated changes. The direct radiative forcing of CO2 drives a weak poleward jet shift in both hemispheres, whereas the indirect (SST) component of the CO2 forcing dominates the total response and drives a zonally asymmetric response in the NH. Hence, understanding the SST-mediated component of atmospheric CO2 forcing appears crucial to unlocking the mechanisms that contribute to forced extratropical circulation changes.},

  abstract = {Projected changes to the global climate system have great implications for the incidence of large infrequent fires in many regions. Here we examine the synoptic-scale and local-scale influences on the incidence of extreme fire weather days and consider projections of the large-scale mean climate to explore future fire weather projections. We focus on a case study region with periodic extreme fire dangers; southeast Tasmania, Australia. We compare the performance of a dynamically downscaled regional climate model with Global Climate Model outputs as a tool for examining the local-scale influences while accounting for high regional variability. Many of the worst fires in Tasmania and the southeast Australian region are associated with deep cold fronts and strong prefrontal winds. The downscaled simulations reproduce this synoptic type with greater fidelity than a typical global climate model. The incidence of systems in this category is projected to increase through the century under a high emission scenario, driven mainly by an increase in the temperature of air masses, with little change in the strength of the systems. The regional climate model projected increase in frequency is smaller than for the global climate models used as input, with a large model range and natural variability. We also demonstrate how a blocking Foehn effect and topographic channelling contributed to the extreme conditions during an extreme fire weather day in Tasmania in January 2013. Effects such as these are likely to contribute to high fire danger throughout the century. Regional climate models are useful tools that enable various meteorological drivers of fire danger to be considered in projections of future fire danger.},

In particular, the relationship between the climate change responses of the storm tracks, as measured by the 2--6~day mean sea level pressure variance, and the equator-to-pole temperature differences at upper- and lower-tropospheric levels is investigated. In the southern hemisphere the responses of the upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature differences are correlated across the models and as a result they share similar associations with the storm track responses. There are large regions in which the storm track responses are correlated with the temperature difference responses, and a simple linear regression model based on the temperature differences at either level captures the spatial pattern of the mean storm track response as well explaining between 30 and 60~\% of the inter-model variance of the storm track responses. In the northern hemisphere the responses of the two temperature differences are not significantly correlated and their associations with the storm track responses are more complicated. In summer, the responses of the lower-tropospheric temperature differences dominate the inter-model spread of the storm track responses. In winter, the responses of the upper- and lower-temperature differences both play a role. The results suggest that there is potential to reduce the spread in storm track responses by constraining the relative magnitudes of the warming in the tropical and polar regions.},

  abstract = {Extreme fire weather events in southeastern Australia are frequently associated with strong cold fronts moving through the area. A recent study has shown that the 850 hPa temperature and the magnitude of its gradient over a small region of southeastern Australia provide a simple means of discriminating the most extreme cold frontal events during the last 40 yr from reanalysis data sets. Applying this technique to 10 general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and calibrating the temperature gradient and temperature climatology of each model's simulation of the climate of the 20th century against the reanalysis climates allows estimates of likely changes in frequency of this type of extreme cold front in the middle and end of the 21st century. Applying this analysis to the output of 10 GCM simulations of the 21st century, using low and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, suggests that the frequency of such events will increase from around 1 event every 2 yr during the late 20th century to around 1 event per year in the middle of the 21st century and 1 to 2 events per year by the end of the 21st century; however, there is a great degree of variation between models. In addition to a greater overall increase under the high emissions scenario, the rate at which the increase occurs amplifies during the second half of the century, whereas under the low emissions scenario the number of extreme cases stabilizes, although still at a higher rate than that experienced in the late 20th century.},

  abstract = {Cold fronts are an important component of subtropical and midlatitude weather systems. While a range of objective front detection methods exist, these methods are only applicable to gridded data and generally require smoothing and threshold parameter changes with differing spatial resolution in order to obtain similar results. This precludes analyses using these methods from using point-location data (such as station observations) or comparing datasets with different spatial resolutions. We present a method using daily maximum temperature changes as a way of identifying strong, dry cold fronts (that is, fronts without much associated rainfall) across a range of datasets. Frontal zones identified using this method are well correlated with cold-front locations using an objective front scheme, and results do not change significantly as data resolution changes over the range from 0.25 to 2.25{$^\circ$}. The method is applied to generate front climatologies in 41 global climate models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), showing these models overestimate the number of cold fronts in polar regions relative to the number over midlatitude land regions, and that there is a large intermodel spread in front occurrence. The method is also applied to southern Australian stations, showing that there are minimal trends in front occurrence for longer running stations, although an increase in front occurrence since 1950 is seen in the southeast of Australia. Interannual variability in strong front occurrence is connected to the state of both El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), with El Ni{\~n}o and negative SAM conditions both seeing increases in the occurrence of strong cold fronts in southeastern Australia.},

However, future changes in these characteristics, as well as their representation in climate models, remain uncertain. We attribute 6-hourly accumulated precipitation to cyclones, moisture transport axes (AR-like features), fronts, and cold air outbreaks, and the combinations thereof in 10 ensemble members of the CESM2-LE between 1960 and 2100 under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. We find that, despite some biases in both precipitation and weather features, CESM2-LE adeptly represents the precipitation characteristics associated with the different combinations of weather features. The combinations of weather features that contribute most to precipitation in the present climate also contribute the most to future changes, both due to changes in intensity as well as frequency. While the increase in precipitation intensity dominates the overall response for total precipitation in the storm track regions, the precipitation intensity for the individual weather features does not necessarily change significantly. Instead, approximately half of the increase in precipitation intensity in the storm track regions can be attributed to a higher occurrence of the more intensely precipitating combinations of weather features, such as the co-occurrence of extratropical cyclones, fronts, and moisture transport axes.},

Changes in the extratropical storm tracks under global warming would impact these transports, the ocean circulation and carbon cycle, and society through changing weather patterns. I show that the southern storm track intensifies in the multimodel mean of simulations of 21st century climate change, and that the seasonal cycle of storm-track intensity increases in amplitude in both hemispheres. I use observations of the present-day seasonal cycle to confirm the relationship between storm-track intensity and the mean available potential energy of the atmosphere, and show how this quantitative relationship can be used to account for much of the varied response in storm-track intensity to global warming, including substantially different responses in simulations with different climate models. The results suggest that storm-track intensity is not related in a simple way to global-mean surface temperature, so that, for example, a stronger southern storm track in response to present-day global warming does not imply it was also stronger in hothouse climates of the past.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 {$^\circ$}C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017--2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018--2020 period.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In this study, the important role of extratropical cyclones and fronts for the atmospheric freshwater flux over the Southern Ocean is analyzed. Based on the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), the freshwater flux associated with cyclones is quantified and it is revealed that the structure of the Southern Hemispheric storm track is strongly imprinted on the climatological freshwater flux. In particular, during austral winter the spiraliform shape of the storm track leads to a band of negative freshwater flux bending toward and around Antarctica, complemented by a strong freshwater input into the midlatitude Pacific, associated with the split storm track. The interannual variability of the wintertime high-latitude freshwater flux is shown to be largely determined by the variability of strong precipitation ({$>$}75th percentile). Using a novel and comprehensive method to attribute strong precipitation uniquely to cyclones and fronts, it is demonstrated that over the Southern Ocean between 60\% and 90\% of the strong precipitation events are due to these synoptic systems. Cyclones are the dominant cause of strong precipitation around Antarctica and in the midlatitudes of the Atlantic and the Pacific, while in the south Indian Ocean and the eastern Atlantic fronts bring most of the strong precipitation. A detailed analysis of the spatial variations of intense front and cyclone precipitation associated with the interannual variability of the wintertime frequency of cyclones in the midlatitude and high-latitude branches of the Pacific storm track underpins the importance of considering both fronts and cyclones in the analysis of the interannual variability of freshwater fluxes.},

Using the new CMIP6 models, we investigate changes to seasonal mean storm tracks and composite wind speeds at different levels of the troposphere for the winter and summer seasons in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Changes are assessed across four different climate scenarios. The seasonal mean storm tracks are predicted to shift polewards in the SH and also in the North Pacific, with an extension into Europe for the North Atlantic storm track. Overall, the number of cyclones will decrease by {$\sim$}5 \% by the end of the 21st century, although the number of extreme cyclones will increase by 4 \% in NH winter. Cyclone wind speeds are projected to strengthen throughout the troposphere in the winter seasons and also summer in the SH, with a weakening projected in NH summer, although there are minimal changes in the maximum wind speed in the lower troposphere. Changes in wind speeds are concentrated in the warm sector of cyclones, and the area of extreme winds may be up to 40 \% larger by the end of the century. The largest changes are seen for the SSP5-85 scenario, although a large amount of change can be mitigated by restricting warming to that seen in the SSP1-26 and 2-45 scenarios. Extreme cyclones show larger increases in wind speed and peak vorticity than the average-strength cyclones, with the extreme cyclones showing a larger increase in wind speed in the warm sector.},

Here an extreme cold front is defined as one for which the maximum temperature at 2 m is at least 17{$^\circ$}C lower on the day following the front. An anticyclone, which precedes the cold front, directs very dry northerlies or northwesterlies from the interior of the continent across the region. The passage of the cold front is followed by strong southerlies or southwesterlies. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim Reanalyses show that this regional synoptic pattern common to all strong cold fronts, and hence severe fire conditions, is a consequence of propagating Rossby waves, which grow to large amplitude and eventually irreversibly overturn. The process of overturning produces the low-level anticyclone and dry conditions over southern Australia, while simultaneously producing an upper level trough and often precipitation in northeastern Australia.},

  abstract = {Presented here is an objective approach to identify, characterize, and track Southern Hemisphere mobile fronts in hemispheric analyses of relatively modest resolution, such as reanalyses. Among the principles in its design were that it should be based on broadscale synoptic considerations and be as simple and easily understood as possible. The resulting Eulerian scheme has been applied to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA)--Interim and a climatology of frontal characteristics, at both the 10-m and 850-hPa levels, derived for the period 1 January 1989--28 February 2009. The knowledge of the character of these features is central to understanding weather and climate over the hemisphere. In both summer and winter the latitude belt 40{$^\circ$}--60{$^\circ$}S hosts the highest frequency of frontal points, but there are significant zonal asymmetries within this band. The climatology reveals that the longest fronts are in the Indian Ocean where mean lengths exceed 2000 km. The mean frontal intensity over the hemisphere tends to be greater at 850 hPa than at 10 m, and greater in winter than in summer. The frontal intensity also shows its maximum in the Indian Ocean. In the mean, the meridional tilt of these fronts is northwest--southeast over much of the midlatitudes and subtropics, and increases with latitude toward the equator. The tilts are of overwhelmingly opposite sign in the coastal Antarctic and subantarctic regions. Broadly speaking, the number of fronts and their mean length and mean intensity exhibit maxima in winter in the midlatitudes (30{$^\circ$}--50{$^\circ$}S), but show a sizeable semiannual variation (maxima in fall and spring) during the year at higher latitudes.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive models of climate change projections have shown that the latitudinal band of extratropical storms will likely shift poleward under global warming. Here we study this poleward shift from a Lagrangian storm perspective, through simulations with an idealized general circulation model. By employing a feature tracking technique to identify the storms, we demonstrate that the poleward motion of individual cyclones increases with increasing global mean temperature. A potential vorticity tendency analysis of the cyclone composites highlights two leading mechanisms responsible for enhanced poleward motion: nonlinear horizontal advection and diabatic heating associated with latent heat release. Our results imply that for a 4 K rise in the global mean surface temperature, the mean poleward displacement of cyclones increases by about 0.85{$^\circ$} of latitude, and this occurs in addition to a poleward shift of about 0.6{$^\circ$} in their mean genesis latitude. Changes in cyclone tracks may have a significant impact on midlatitude climate, especially in localized storm tracks such as the Atlantic and Pacific storm tracks, which may exhibit a more poleward deflected shape.},

  abstract = {Day-to-day (DTD) temperature variation reflects a rapid weather variability, which significantly affects human health and ecosystems. However, while a few of studies have addressed certain regional variations, no global pattern of rapid temperature variability has yet been investigated. Here, using global daily temperature observation data, we present a study of the worldwide spatial heterogeneity of rapid temperature variability and its long-term trends over the past 60 years. We found a significant decline in northern mid and high latitudes in boreal winter but a significant increase in the Arctic coast, South China and Australia in boreal summer during the study period. Using observational data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble simulations, we further demonstrate that the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration leads to a significant change in meridional temperature gradient, which in turn results in the observed decline of rapid temperature variability in the mid and high latitudes and the increase in rapid temperature variability in Arctic Coast in summer. In contrast, human-induced increase in GHGs and aerosol accounts for approximately one third and two third of the decline of rapid temperature variability in North China in boreal summer, respectively. However, the increase in summer rapid temperature variability in southern China appears to be primarily associated with the long-term internal climate variability. It is further shown that, based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble simulations, the projected rapid temperature variability shows a significant decrease in the high latitudes in winter but a slight increase in tropical zones by the end of this century. These findings clearly reveal an important role of human activities on the historical and future rapid temperature variability.},
